Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Scripts work in following sequence
step 1 - creating directory and downloading zip file 
step 2 - un zipping file and reading data readme files
step 3 - reading raw data in to R
step 4 - adding column lables and columns for activity and subject
step 5 - tyding up and merging data
step 6 - summarizing data
